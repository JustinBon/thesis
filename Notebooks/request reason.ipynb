    "Metadata about wob requests can be usefull to collect. Luckily, when the government agency to which the request was send to completes the request, it also gives a decision document and a inventory list in addition to the documents that were requested. With these two documents the reason for a request, the date on which the request was received and completed, the number of documents concidered, the number of documents (partially) released, and the number of documents not released can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reason for request\n",
    "The reason for the wob request can be found in the decision document. In this document it states in one sentence a summary of what has been requested. This summary is what needs to be extracted. This summary is usually indicated by a keyword or keywords. These keywords come down to dutch versions of \"requested\", \"information about\", or \"publication of\". What follows is a list of all keywords used in dutch:\n",
    "- verzocht\n",
    "- u verzoekt\n",
    "- om informatie over\n",
    "- uw verzoek ziet\n",
    "- om openbaarmaking van\n",
    "- more to come\n",
    "When one of these keywords are found, all following text is extracted until a the next period occurs. To do this, a regular expression was used. \n",
    "\n",
    "keyword([^.]+?)\\\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where keyword is one of the words or phrases listed above. The expression first finds one of these keywords and then matches any alpha-numerical character until the first period is found. Before the regular expression can be used however, the text needs some preprocessing. First, exessive newlines are removed. Second, all letters are converted to lowercase letters. This is done so that the regular expression will match the keywords even though in the text the the keywords are written with capitalization. This has to be done as regular expressions are case sensitive. Last, for any word or abbreviation in the text that includes a period where the period does not indicate the end of a sentence, said period have to be removed otherwise it will trip up the regular expression. After this, the neccessary information can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the regular expressions have been run, the matches need to be checked for duplicates. This can happen when the decision document states for example \"the request if for information about [...]\". In this case the same sentence would be matched for the keyword \"request\" and \"information about\". This would match the same sentence twice so only one of these is needed and the other is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the extractor, a different method than the other extractors was used: the panoptic quality metric. With this metric precision, recall, and F1 scores are still calculated, but with different method. It uses the overlap between the ground truth and the prediction to measure the performance of a model. First the intersect and union of the ground truth and prediction are calculated. The intersect is the overlap between the two and the union is the combination of the two. With this the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric is calculated. TODO[INSERT CALCULTION HERE]. The IoU can then be compared to a threshold value. If the IoU is higher then the treshold it counts as a true positive, if it is lower it counts as both a false negative and a false positive. Presicion, recall and F1 score can then be calculated. \n",

    "# Relevant dates\n",
    "There are two relevant dates that can be extracted from the decision document: the date on which the request was received and the date on which the request was completed. The decision document has these two dates at the beginning. The completion date is same date as when the document was made so that is always the very first date in the document. The date of request is always in the first sentence of the document as they all start with as follows: \"In your letter of 01 januari 2022\". This means that the first and second date that are found in the document are the relevant dates to extract. Sometimes the date a request was send is not the same as the date the request was received. This happens when the request is send by post. In this case the decision document states: \"in your letter of 01 januari 2022, received on 05 januari 2022\". The following regular expression was used to check if this is the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "'ontvangen op ([^.]+?)\\,'\n",
    "\n",
    " In this case the first and third date are the relevant dates. To actually extract the dates, the dates extractor described here TODO[REF HERE] was used. These dates can then also be used to check how long the request took to fulfull and if it was done in the time that they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Number of documents\n",
    "The inventory lists contain an overview of all documents that were found that fall in the scope of the request. The list also has information about which documents were made public, which were made partially public, which were not made public and also the documents that were already public.\n"

    "One problem the used approach is sensetive to is mistakes made in the OCR process. The regular expressions look some keywords and, when those are found, the end of the sentence. If in the OCR process a mistake was made in on of the keywords or if the period at the end of the sentence wasn't recognized as a period, the regular expression won't match it even though it should.
