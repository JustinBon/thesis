1 Assessing cross -neutralization activity for SARS -CoV -2 spike mutants  SSI 02. November 2020,  , senior  researcher  SSI has so far identifed seven unique mink mutations/changes in the spike protein the sars -cov-2 variants in mink and infected peiople with contact to the farms. We have tested the first variant  from farm -1 and here we have tested a variant with  four simul taneous changes in the spike. This  variant is dominating farm -6, 9, 10, 14, 18 (CHCNR 99768, 10967, 92288, 91966, 97712) and in the  present experiments we isolated this same mink variant virus from a human patient and used it to  evaluate if this virusvaria nt was sensitive or not to neutralizing antibodies (antisera) from a  collection of convalescent individuals.  Virus culture  A mink and  human clinical sample containing t he SARS -CoV-2 virus  with the  spike mutations  of interest  is identified. The virus  is gro wn on mammalian cells, a monkey kidney cell line named VeroE6 , from  the clinical sample in two subsequent rounds . Prior to use,  nucleotide sequencing of the isolated virus  is used to confir m that the cell culture process did not  introduce  additional mutati ons that were not  present in the  original  clinical sample.  To date, all viruses evaluate d for  cross -neutralization of antisera  were identical in the spike protein compared to that  found in  the clinical sample.  Neutralization assay  in Biosafety -3 laboratory  To determine if a mutant virus has reduced sensitivity to  existing  neutralizing antibodies, a  predetermined amount of  the mutant  virus is mixed with serially diluted sera from patients that were  infected with SARS -CoV-2 early in the Danish epidemic.  The same sera is mixed with the same amount  of virus from a strain that does not have the spike mutations.  The virus and sera are incub ated for 1  hour to allow the antibodies in the sera to bind to the virus.  The virus/antibody mix is added to VeroE6  cells and incubated for 24 hours.  Those antibodies that neutralize the virus will block its ability to infect  cells and thus lead to a lower  amount of virus present in the cells.  After 24 hours, the amount of virus  in the cells are measured by fixing the cells to the cell culture plate. This fixation process exposes the  virus proteins produced during the infection of the cells. One of these pr oteins is the SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In a standard ELISA targeting the nucleocapsid protein, the amount of virus is  determined. Using appropriate controls for each virus evaluated, a 50% cut -off value is calculated. The  serum dilution at the 50%  cut-off value is reported as the neutralization titer.  Results  Convalescent sera from  9 people (10 serum samples were tested, but one was inconclusive, so only 9  are reported ) previously infected with SARS -CoV-2 early in the Danish epidemic were used to ev aluate  cross -neutralization activity against a mutant virus. Each serum sample was tested in duplicate with  the mutant v irus and the reference virus (without  spike mutations).  Serum sample   Neutralisation Titer  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Reference virus  39 68 54 67 186 >1280846 186 291 Mutant virus  28 5 9 30 67 >1280606 54 177 % Difference  -28% -93% -83% -55%-64%0% -28%-71%-39%
2 The mutant virus resulted in reduced neutralization activity for 8 out of 9 sera tested  when compared  to a virus that lacks the spike mutations . The effect varied between the sera and ranged from a  reduction of 25% to as high as 93% neutralization activity.  In conclusion , this  indicate that mink virus variants with four of the seven  identified mink -mutations/changes in the   spike protein show less sensitivity  (resistance) for neutralizing antibodies  from persons with  previous covid -19 infection.  It is important to note that these results are  preliminary and are in the process of being  confirmed in a n independent repeat experiment, but  suggest that mink - antibodies.
